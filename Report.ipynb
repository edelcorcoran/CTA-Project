    "In this report the concept of sorting and sorting algorithms will be introduced and related concepts such as complexity (time and space), performance/benchmarking, in-place sorting, stable sorting, comparator functions, comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorts will be examined. Five different sorting algorithms will be outlined and discussed then benchmarking will follow to help analyse and contrast the various algorithms. The algorithms will include three simple comparison-sort algorithms (Bubble, Selection and Insertion), one efficient comparison-based sort (Merge) and finally a non-comparison sort (Counting).\n",

    "**<i>What is a sorting algorithm?</i>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting algorithms are used to arrange a list of inputs into a particular order. The algorithm applies a set of instructions to the list in order to achieve the desires order, for example an array of unsorted numbers could be arrange in order from smallest to largest value.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a \"less than or equal to\" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list\"[1]. Examples: bubble / insertion / selection / merge\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-comparison sort algorithms will sort a given list or input without comparing the values of the elements with the list. The counting sort algorithm is an example of a non-comparison sort.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<i>Design</i>**\n",
    "\n",
    "A well designed algorithm will have well defined inputs (eg. a list of random numbers) which are fed into the algorithms in order to produce clearly defined outputs (ie. the sorted listof numbers). The algorithm should run through each defined step before terminating. To be able to rely on the algorithm it must provide a correct outcome or solution consistently when used and it must demand resonable computer resources it make it feasible to implement. Realistically an algorithm should also complete its task in an acceptable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<i>What is benchmarking?</i>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmarking process will simply measure the performance of the various sporting algorithms in order to compare and evaluate them. It will help identify the strenghts and weaknesses for each algorithms.\n",

    "**<i>Main factors to consider when choosing a Sorting Algorithm:</i>**\n",

    "**<i>Complexity and Performance</i>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm performance is dependent on the demand requirements for things like time and memory to enable the program is run. This depends on the computer resources available and the code. Complexity of algorithms looks at what happens as the input size increases. Complexity can influence performance but performance won't effect complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two complexity measures of the efficiency of an algorithm are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Space complexity is a function describing the amount of memory or space an algorithm takes to run to completion in terms of the amount of input size. \n",

There's no single algorithm which is optimal for every possible input so it crucial that the user understands the behaviour of the algorithms being considered as well as the problem which will be solved. Algorithms are platform independent and to compare the complexity of algorithms the method used must be platform independent.\n",

Big O notation is generally used to describe execution times in the worst case scenarios. \"Big O notation (with a capital latin letter O, not a zero) is a symbolism used in complexity theory, mathematics and computer science to describe the asymptotic behaviours of functions. In short, Big O notation measures how quickly a function grows or declines. The growth rate of a function is also called its order.\"[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average case: of the algorithm is the function defined by the average number of steps taken on any input size n. This would be the typical behaviour of the algorithm.\n",

The function is defined by the minimum number of steps taken on any instance of input size n hence best runtime. In this scenario the algorithm does the least work. Omega notation is generally used to describe complexity in best case scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Typically, algorithmic complexity falls into one of a number families (i.e. the growth in its execution time with respect to increasing input size n is of a certain order). The effect of higher order growth functions becomes more significant as the size n of the input set is increased.\"[3] The image below gives a visual of the order of growth classifications.\n",

The inefficient nature of the algorithm is also evident in the example below in that the array is effectively sorted after iteration or pass 2 but the algorithm still requires another pass to complete. \n",

    "\n",
    "The selection sort is a simple comparison based sorting algorithm that uses in-place sorting and is unstable as it may change the order of elements with the same value. The time complexity is ùëõ^2 in best, worst and average cases scenarios, the sorting operation involves two nested loops. The arrangement of elements in the input list does not affect its performance but the size of the array can affect the performance and it works better with small input n sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection sort treats sements the input array into a sorted and an unsorted portion or array, it will search for the minimum element from the unsorted subarray on the right which is then picked and moved to the sorted subarray on the left. The sort repeatedly searches for minimum values until the list if fully sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below the algorithm will search the array to find it smallest element 4 which will be swapped with the first element 15 at index position 0. The sort will search from index 1 to index n-1 to find the minmum value which is 5, this remains at index 1. Now the sort searches from index 2 to n-1 to find the next minimum value which is 8 which is swapped with 64 (index 2). This process repeats until the entire list is sorted. \n",
